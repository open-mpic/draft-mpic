        Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration (MPIC) Service
                draft-westerbaan-secdispatch-mpic-latest

Abstract

   This memo defines an API for a service to offer multi-perspective
   issuance corroboration (MPIC) for domain control validation.  Ballot
   SC-67 v3 of CA/B forum requires MPIC to be performed by all
   certification authorities (CAs) in the Web PKI.  This API allows CAs
   to use external MPIC infrastructure.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  DCV

   Before issuing a certificate to a subscriber, certificate authorities
   are required to validate that the subscriber indeed controls the
   domains on the certificate.  For this purpose certificate authorities
   use various methods of domain control validation (DCV), including but
   not limited to via HTTP, DNS, and ALPN.

1.2.  MPIC

   Several, but not all, CAs use the specific DCV methods of ACME
   [RFC8555].  Domain control validation is vulnerable to DNS and BGP
   hijacks.  These can be partially mitigated by performing DCV from
   multiple vantage points, which is dubbed "multiple perspective
   issuance corroboration" (MPIC). corroboration (MPIC) for domain
   control validation.  Ballot SC-67 v3 of CA/B forum requires MPIC to
   be performed by all certification authorities (CAs) in the future.

1.3.  MPIC service

   Running MPIC requires maintaining a presence across the globe.  For
   smaller CAs it may make sense to run a shared MPIC service or
   outsource it to a third party.  This memo specifies a standardised
   API for such a usecase.  Another usecase is for a CA to have a
   standby MPIC service in case its primary fails.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  API Structure

   The MPIC API implements a system for domain validation and CAA record
   checking using multiple perspectives across different regions.

   A MPIC service is identified by a HTTPS url.  As a running example,
   say https://mpc.example.com/staging.

   A client requests a MPIC validation from the service by sending a
   POST request to the resource /mpic/draft-00 below the service URL.
   In the running example https://mpc.example.com/staging/mpic/draft-00.

   [[ The final version of the API will use /mpic/v1.  Incompatible
   versions of the draft will bump the -00. ]]

   The body of the HTTP POST is a JSON object that describs the MPIC
   request.  The service will respond with a JSON object containing MPIC
   results.

   There are three different MPIC validation methods, described below.
   The request object has a method field that allows to distinguish
   between each.

3.1.  caa validation method

   A caa requests asks the MPIC service to retrieve the relevant CAA DNS
   records for a given domain from multiple vantage points.

   This method has the following specific fields.

   *  domain (required, string): The domain to check the CAA records
      for.

   An example request is given below.

   POST /staging/mpic/draft-00
   Host: mpc.example.com
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
    "method": "caa",
    "domain": "some.example.com"
   }

   If successful (described in TODO REF below), the response object
   contains a success field set to true, and an caa field, which itself
   is an object with two fields:

   *  domain The domain on which the CAA records were found.  This could
      be a parent domain of the requested domain.

   *  records A list of base64 encoded CAA records.

   An example of a response for a succesful validation.

   {
    "success": true,
    "caa": {
     "domain": "example.com",
     "records": ["AAVpc3N1ZWxldHNlbmNyeXB0Lm9yZw=="]
    }
   }

   On failure, the response object will have the success field set to
   false, and an error field describing the error.

   [[ TODO do we to define the possible errors, or at least assign some
   codes? ]]

   An example of a response for an unsuccesful validation.

{
 "success": false,
 "error": "LIS saw record 'xyz' on example.com which was not present from vantage point LIS"
}

   [[ TODO How much information to return on error to help debug, and
   how structured should it be?  I'd say it's good to be helpful, but
   it's bad to be structured as it's less readable. ]]

3.2.  http method

   A http requests the MPIC server to perform ACME HTTP challenge
   validation [RFC8555] for the domain's HTTP server from each
   distributed vantage point.

   Performs a GET from multiple vantage points, and checks whether the
   body matches expectation.  Optionally, it allows performing an
   additional CAA record lookup for the domain.

   The request JSON object has the following specific fields.

   *  domain (required, string): The domain name being verified.

   *  path (required, string): The path at which the ACME HTTP challenge
      resource is provisioned.

   *  expected (required, string): Expected body of the response [[ TODO
      what if it's not UTF-8? ]]

   *  caa-check (optional, boolean): Performs CAA validation at the same
      time for the domain as described above.  Defaults to true.

   POST /staging/mpic/draft-00
   Host: mpc.example.com
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
    "method": "http",
    "domain": "some.example.com",
    "path": ".well-known/acme-challenge/token",
    "expected": "challenge_token",
    "caa-check": false,
   }

   The MPIC server constructs a URL by populating the URL template
   [RFC6570], http://{domain}/{path}, and verifies that the resulting
   URL is well-formed, before making a HTTP GET request to the URL from
   each vantage point.  Each vantage point SHOULD follow redirects when
   dereferencing the URL.  The MPIC server verifies that expected value
   provided by the client matches with the body of the response received
   from each vantage point.

   If the above verifications succeeds, then the validation is
   successful.  If the request fails, or the body does not pass these
   checks, then it has failed.

   Along side, the MPIC server queries for the CAA records for the
   domain if the caa-check request parameter is set to "true".

   If either HTTP or CAA validation (when requested) fail, the response
   objects contains a top-level success field set to false, and contains
   an error field that describes the error.

   If both succeed, the response object contains a top-level success
   field set to true.

   If a CAA check was requested, the response object will contain a top
   level caa field as described in Section 3.1.

   An example of a response for a succesful validation with caa-check
   set to false.

   {
    "success": true,
   }

   An example of a response for a succesful validation with caa-check
   set to true.

   {
    "success": true,
    "caa": {
      "domain": "example.com",
      "records": ["AAVpc3N1ZWxldHNlbmNyeXB0Lm9yZw=="]
    }
   }

   An example of a response where the validation failed with caa-check
   set to true, and the caa method being successful.

   {
    "success": false,
    "error": "HTTP found unexpected value at LIS vantage point",
   }

   Similarly example of a response where caa-check set to true, and both
   methods fail.

3.3.  dns method

   Required request fields

   *  domain

   *  record-type

   *  prefix

   *  expected

   Optional

   *  caa Defaults to true.

   Response is same as with http.
