If there is actual logic to making retries more useful than that, then I believe it belongs in the service and should be opaque to the client.\r\n\r\nThe specific retry logic I proposed is discussed here: https://github.com/open-mpic/open-mpic-specification/issues/3\r\nIt attempts to maintain determinism while providing some value to retrying corroboration with disjoint sets of perspectives (cohorts). The client does not get to pick what perspectives are in what disjoint set, and there is a small and finite number of such cohorts that would be created.\r\n\r\nThis is another situation where the two paradigms -- sellf-hosted vs SaaS -- carry different implications about what makes the most sense to do.\r\n\r\nI can't assume that a self-hosted perspective will always be operating perfectly. As a result, there can be value to retries for a self-hosted solution, as they could provide feedback on the behavior of individual perspectives while not letting perspectives that are failing for reasons other than BGP Hijacking mislead corroboration (e.g., London AWS Lambda is down for whatever reason), yet still ensure that passing corroboration follows the spirit and letter of the requirements.

An alternative is for the CA to retry the request to the MPIC service.\r\n\r\nMy comment assumed we were discussing deterministic retries initiated _by the client_ (CA) in this thread. Client retries and MPIC service internal retries are two separate issues imo.\r\n\r\nSo for client initiated retries, I think it makes sense to be deterministic on the set of perspectives each time. We dont have to define an upper limit on possible retries in the standard. Need to make sure adversaries cannot trick the MPIC service to choose its favorable perspectives.\r\n\r\nFor internal MPIC service retries, I feel @sciros approach is a good one. The service can have the ability to choose different 'healthy' perspectives if some run fails with 'non-healthy' perspectives outcomes (where health is determine by some error types that we can define). This keeps choice of perspectives completely opaque and deterministic to the client at least, while still maintaining useful internal retry logic. Keeping it opaque is the key.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

I am thinking of proposing a change to that, and have a pull request that's under review which nudges validation logic more towards the requirements-aware side of things.\r\nAt the same time, the quorum count is currently an optional parameter. In its absence, the default can either be fully configurable by whoever owns the services (i.e. set it to something like 5 in a config file) or it can be programmatically derived based on the count of remote perspectives being interrogated (i.e. `perspective_count - 1` or `perspective_count - 2` depending on whether that count is <6 or not.)\r\n\r\nAnyway in the interest of making fast progress on this, here's my current thinking and what I'm considering implementing in the coming days, though I'm 100% OK with changing completely if my reasoning is faulty. \r\n\r\nI propose that quorum count remain an optional parameter to specify to the service, to allow for a higher-than-minimum-allowed-by-the-requirements threshold. If you want a quorum of 100%, that should be possible.\r\n\r\nI also propose that the default quorum is requirements-aware (programmatically derived). The logic used for deriving it can be policy-specific... that's something I hadn't thought of. I don't have a strong opinion on whether that should be how the service applies logic (i.e., it can apply a _non-current policy_) or whether it should just always be updated to reflect the current policy, and versioned accordingly. Perhaps the latter?\r\n\r\nI also propose that the quorum count in the API request (assuming it's a whole number) is allowed to be below the required minimum only if the API is run in a diagnostics/dev mode with value validation (as opposed to request structure validation) disabled. That, or include a warning in the response that the quorum count used is below the required threshold and therefore cannot actually be used to support cert issuance.

Due to the nature of the industry terms, there's no obviously elegant approach.\r\n\r\nI figured an easy way to start the conversation would be to throw some ideas out there to beat up on. Gemini and ChatGPT were happy to oblige, though each gave me quite different results for my question about this. Here was my prompt:\r\n\r\n> Let's talk about PKI and certificate issuance. I want to brainstorm endpoint naming for an API that would do multi-perspective issuance corroboration for various validation checks.\r\nThere are several kinds of \"verifications\" or \"validations\" that get run as part of issuing a signed certificate. Correct me where I'm wrong, because I want to be very technically pedantic about this, but I think of the checks as being, roughly, DCV (domain control validation) and then CAA (certificate authority authorization) checking. With DCV the word \"validation\" is already in the name, and with CAA it's not, so I think many people in the PKI space do refer to CAA record validation as a \"CAA check,\" and I've seen the occasional article where, perhaps for the sake of parallel terminology, people will talk of a \"DCV check.\" But if I wanted to have an API with endpoints that carry out these various verifications, what is a good way to organize and name them? Perhaps DCV should be broken out into the various validation methods? And then CAA is just alongside those as \"yet another record type\" to check the presence of? Or maybe it's \"/dcv-check\" and \"/caa-check\" and then specifying in the request body what kind of DCV validation type to carry out (HTTP, etc.)? Please ruminate on this for me.\r\n\r\nGemini gave me the following options:\r\n\r\n> **Option 1:** Hierarchical Structure; clear separation of concerns, detailed endpoint names.\r\n> `/validations/dcv`\r\n> `/validations/dcv/http`\r\n> `/validations/dcv/dns`\r\n> `/validations/dcv/email`\r\n> ...\r\n> `/validations/caa`\r\n> `/validations/ocsp` (or other validation types)\r\n> \r\n> **Option 2:** Flat Structure with Query Parameters; simplicity, flexibility.\r\n> `/validate` (or `/verify`)\r\n> Query parameters:\r\n> `type`: `dcv`, `caa`, `ocsp`, etc.\r\n> `method`: `http`, `dns`, `email`, etc. (for DCV)\r\n> \r\n> **Option 3:** Combined Approach; balance between hierarchy and simplicity.\r\n> `/dcv`\r\n> `/dcv/http`\r\n> `/dcv/dns`\r\n> `/dcv/email`\r\n> `/caa`\r\n> `/ocsp` (or other validation types)\r\n> `/validate` for generic validation requests with query parameters \r\n\r\nPersonally I wasn't fond of any of these, although if I had to choose between the above I'd go with some version of option 1 or option 3.\r\n\r\nChatGPT 4o gave me a very different answer, seemingly being led by my prompt a bit more, so I found myself biased towards it.\r\n\r\n> 1. Endpoint Structure Overview\r\n>   **DCV** (Domain Control Validation): Since DCV involves different methods (HTTP, DNS, email, etc.), it makes sense to either have \r\n> separate endpoints for each method or a single endpoint with the method specified in the request.\r\n>   **CAA** (Certificate Authority Authorization): CAA is more straightforward, typically involving a single check to see if the domain has specific CAA records that allow the issuance of a certificate by a CA.\r\n> 2. Naming Conventions\r\n> Consistency is key. If you choose to use the term \"check\" for CAA, it might be beneficial to apply it uniformly, even to DCV, despite \"validation\" already being in the name.\r\n> 3. Potential Endpoint Structures\r\n>     1. **Option A**: Separate Endpoints for Each DCV Method\r\n>     `/dcv/http-check`: Validates domain control via HTTP.\r\n>     `/dcv/dns-check`: Validates domain control via DNS.\r\n>     `/dcv/email-check`: Validates domain control via email.\r\n>     `/caa-check`: Checks the CAA records for the domain.\r\n>     Pros: Clear separation of concerns, Easy to manage and extend if new DCV methods are added.\r\n>     Cons: Potentially more endpoints to maintain.\r\n>    \r\n>     2. **Option B**: Unified DCV Endpoint with Method in Request\r\n>     `/dcv-check`: Single endpoint for DCV validation. The method (HTTP, DNS, email) is specified in the request body or as a query parameter.\r\n>     `/caa-check`: Same as in Option A.\r\n>     Pros: Fewer endpoints, which might simplify API documentation, Easier to handle common validation logic.\r\n>     Cons: Slightly more complex request handling. Less explicit endpoint naming.\r\n\r\nI'm personally partial to ChatGPT's **Option B** (and using a request body parameter for the method), as that's the direction I've proposed taking the open-mpic reference implementation for now and it's very close to its current state (v1.0.1 has `/validation` and `/caa-check` paths). But I don't know if it's the best direction to take and figure this is one of the first things we should sort out anyway for a standard API.",

          "body": "Thanks Bas, that's a good point. I think specifying `/mpic/{version}` (or draft) as the base URL is good.\r\nI also agree that putting the version in the URL is sensible if you want to enable/encourage running multiple versions of the API. Especially if you are envisioning a CT log kind of situation -- many CAs posting to a few MPIC enablers -- this makes a lot of sense. If the open source, roll-your-own-mpic implementation manages to find adoption, it may be a different dynamic, but that's far from a sure thing and this kind of flexibility in the API is valuable.\r\n\r\nThat still leaves the question of the method endpoints. I agree that `dcv-html`, `dcv-dns`, etc. being separate endpoints is not particularly useful the way it can be for CT. So it's more about what makes for a more elegant and usable spec. I personally do think that there should be _some_ request path organization of what to corroborate, so it's not just \"do mpic\" and then the requested corroboration(s) is buried in the request body. To me that would feel clunky and unconventional.\r\n\r\nHow do we feel about, for example:\r\n`/mpic/v1/caa-check` (and specifying CAA specific parameters in the body)\r\n`/mpic/v1/dcv-check` (and specifying the DCV method and other relevant parameters in the body)\r\n`/mpic/v1/dcv-with-caa-check`\r\n\r\nOr is there a preference instead for paths like like `/mpic/v1/caa` and `/mpic/v1/dcv/{method}`?",

          "body": "The main advantage of moving all mandatory parameters to the path I can think of is that the endpoint could potentially accept an empty POST body. However, I do not particularly feel this is needed and I actually think it might be detrimental. Often I feel this type of rich path is useful for resource that have GET requests associated with them since GET requests cannot have bodies, so clean encoding in the path is essential (e.g., /blog/post/{id} can accept PUT to update the post or GET to view the post). I do not think the API should use GET, so there can be a body.\r\n\r\nThe downside with mandatory parameters in the path is that it makes the API rely on two separate encoding schemes: URL and JSON. URLs have limitations on acceptable characters and non-standard characters need to be escaped. JSON also has non-acceptable characters in strings which are escaped. I would argue 1. API client implementations are more likely to get the JSON escaping correct than the URL escaping. Most languages have a JSON library which takes in native objects and just makes them compliant JSON. URL escaping is also supported in most languages, but there is a risk that implementers will just use standard string replacement to build the URLs which could cause escapement errors. 2. For most methods there is some potentially rather large mandatory data which I think is sloppy to have in a URL. Almost every method needs an expected challenge. Some Sectigo challenges I have completed use a 3-line long file. Thus, a URL with all required parts is going to read something like: /mpic/v1/dcv/http/{domain}/{path}/{challenge} where path and challenge will both have tons of escape characters as path needs to escape all the \"/\" and challenge needs to escape all the \"\\n\". Additionally, the key-value format of JSON improves readability because it is not dependent on parameter order, but instead each what each parameter is is clearly identified. IMO the readability of the above proposed URL inferior to viewing a post body that reads:\r\n{\r\ndomain: \"...\",\r\npath: \"...\",\r\nchallenge: \"...\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nFinally, I will mention that CloudFlare's original MPIC API implementation I first tested had an issue with the base64-URL escaping system used in ACME that caused an error in about 1 in 10 requests. This has since been fixed, but I do think it reinforces the point that URL escaping can be non-trivial.",

          "body": "I definitely advocate not putting anything in the URL in this case as far as request-specific data, for all the reasons @birgelee lays out. Splitting parameters between the URL and body is unintuitive for clients and clunky at best for implementers. Also since this is an HTTP POST that is sending information to the server, it's expected that there is an accompanying request body.\r\n\r\nThinking about the earlier discussion points more, I also don't really like the idea of putting DCV methods (http, etc.) into the URL, because of the way the URL drives logic. DCV vs CAA is quite different logic as far how the check is carried out, and requires different configuration parameters. DCV HTTP vs DCV DNS etc. is on the other hand a bit deeper in the logic and so what will happen is the validation method will get pulled into a configuration parameter anyway, to be tossed over to the remote perspectives who then figure out what to do.\r\n\r\nI'm almost thinking Bas's idea of one endpoint for the whole thing (\"do MPIC\") and then the desired check (dcv, caa, dcv-with-caa) being a parameter might work fairly well. There's one practical issue with it, which is that I like to avoid clients needing to know magic strings whenever possible when specifying params, and this enumeration (dcv, caa, dcv-with-caa) is definitely a bit of that. Explicit URL endpoints spelled out in the OpenAPI spec make this more straightforward. The rest of the parameters are more either numbers, URLs, etc. except for DCV validation method (http, dns, etc.) which have a bit of the same issue. The other thing to worry about is, then, that we still need a parameter for the type of check we're doing, and I suppose \"check_type\" would work fine but that'd be something else to align on. I suppose in the end it's \"six of one, half-dozen of the other.\"\r\n\r\nSo I'd either go with `mpic/v1/mpic` (can't just do `mpic/v1/`) or `mpic/v1/dcv, mpic/dcv/caa` and such. Coin-toss as to which; the implementing code can be nearly identical (switch on request path vs switch on check type).",

In an Open API spec we can specify different JSON schemas for different endpoints allowing the distinct schema for `/dcv/http` and `/dcv/dns` to be strictly associated with the different endpoints. Thus, if I were to pass a request to `/dcv/http` with an validation details object formatted for `/dcv/dns`, we could detect this protocol violation at the spec level (there are several tools that generate request validators based on Open API specs). Given the current system (where a magic string is passed to the method parameter which determines the schema of the validation-details object), the Open API spec can only specify the validation details must be OneOf the required schemas, but cannot associate the proper schema with the magic string passed. Clearly this is an Open API specific consideration and the human-readable format of an RFC is not bound to these types of limitations.",

How should IP address targets be handled in the future?",

Not sure if CAA records for IP addresses are a thing.

It is not clear to me upon further review of the standards that a single back end engine could appropriately handle both methods without it simply being two methods under the hood masquerading as a single method.
